euroCurrencies
==============

Roundup
-------
With this small class you are able to load a currency value based on 1 Euro. 

Detail
------
The data is loaded from the ecb (european central bank). The currency data is updated only once a day. You have to pass the [ISO 4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) value for the currency.

Usage
-----
First initialize the class. In this example we use Pound sterling.

```swift
let converter = EuroCurrencies(currency: "GBP")
```
then you are able to get the convert value by calling

```swift
Task {
            do {
                let rate = try await converter.fetchConversionRate()
                await MainActor.run {
                    euroAmount = converter.convertToEuro(inputAmount)
                }
            } catch {
                await MainActor.run {
                    errorMessage = "Fehler bei der Konvertierung: \(error.localizedDescription)"
                }
            }
        }


```
the block is only called when the currency value is loaded. So you might have to wait. It is also possible to call these properties:

```swift
public var lastUpdateDate: Date?
```

but they might be nil if you haven't called `getConversionRate` before. If you have ever loaded the value of the currency, then the last value is stored in the user defaults. And you can get immediate access to the properties.
